            <h3>Personal</h3>
            <p>Hey there! My name is Bennett Schoonerman. At a lengthy 6'5" its safe to say I stand out from the rest. I'm from 
            <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g48892-Williamson_Finger_Lakes_New_York-Vacations.html" target="new"> Williamson New York </a>,
                A small town about 20 miles east of Rochester NY. In my spare time I like to get out and enjoy all that this beautiful area has to offer. 
                I'm an avid watersports enthusiast. I love spending time on Lake Ontario or the Finger Lakes water skiing or riding jetski's. Growing up
                in the core of apple country I have developed an interest in fruit farming and the hard cider and wine industries. I love working with my hands and
                building things from scratch, which I feel is partially what led me to becoming a developer. Coding for me is like building with Legos.
                Once you know how to work with a few pieces, the only limit is your imagination. Additionaly learning how to work with new pieces or
                technology can let you create some really cool projects.
                When im not being a code monkey you could find me creating music. I contracted the music bug from 
                Guitar Hero 2 and have since developed a passion 
                for writing and recording music. I can play Guitar, Piano, Ukuele, and im eager to pick up the banjo next. I still casusally jam with some good buddies when time allows.

            <h3>Education</h3>
            <p>I Graduated From Williamson Senior High School with my Advanced Regents Diploma and started college at Monroe Community college
                pursing a degree in Optical and Imaging science. I liked it and found it pretty interesting but I knew that it wasnt what I wanted
                to do as a career. The following year I transfered to Finger Lakes Community College where I earned my Assicates Degree in 
                <a href="https://www.flcc.edu/academics/newmedia/" target="new"> New Media</a>. It was here that I was exposed to media development
                and wanted to continue my education. This led me to the New Media Interactive Development Program at RIT where I will earn my Bachelors
                Degree in the spring 2019. My education path has given me a diverse background in design, development, and basic optical systems. I pride 
                myself on being a jack of all trades and a master of some. In the development world with technolgy progressing so rapidly I will never
                stop learning. But thats ok with me!
